				Aaron Clark Maximus was born somewhere in the late 1930's in a Nazist Germany.  Somehow gaining the access to prototype time travel at the age of 10, he was disgusted at Germany's state and hitched a ride to what he thought was the best way out.  Although as if he was born again, he arrived at Texas in 2004, to later be taken by new parents who had 2 kids a few years older than he named Paul and Naomi.  After finishing a dreaded experience of high school, Aaron proudly joined the Army when he was 18.  There, he met a similar peer who preferred to be called Nate.  The two usually worked well together and soon grew higher in the ranks as the years went on.  A few years into service, Aaron was beginning to remember the 1940's and took any free time he had to research all information he could find.  Fascinated by what he left behind, he looked into research notes and projects inquiring the impossible, such as time travel, immortality, and necromancy.  
				<br>
				<br>
				By continuing the limited research with his own studies, he quickly opened opportunities all over the field of science.  He also became rapidly wealthy, eventually becoming one of the richest persons in America through his research, the media, and even by starring in advertisements and movies due to his popularity.  How his popularity grew so quick, not even Nate understood.  Plagued by immortality and the grief of producing it, he became powerful in the military and in science as he also grew old.  Although he did not age in looks past 30, he is older than 150. There is so much to learn about Aaron that it's impossible to explain it all on this page. Look around for at least some more of his story.
