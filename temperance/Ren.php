				<em>Upset, sure.  Angry, no.</em>

				<br><br>
				Born to an admiring housewife and dangerous mercenary, Ren Kimura was the focus of conversations from day 1 moving to Yokohama, Japan.  A cute child by other's opinion, she always had classmates wanting to talk to her despite Ren's social awkwardness.  With countless failed attempts by her peers to gain her friendship, rumors bustled around that she must have issues at home.  After confronting her father, "Uso" (Lie, Liar) as everyone called him, he gave Ren advice that she had to act as the better person and ignore the rumors.  The rumors got bad enough that Ren would be assaulted, and she had no one to defend her.  Though she got into fights (that she would always brutally win) a lot, Ren made it through her tormenting peers and high school just barely.  She was on the verge of a complete outrage by simply having to deal with other people.  Her mother didn't approve of her following her father's footsteps as a gun for hire and everyone she knew was snobby in some way and always rejected her mother to look cool.
				<br><br>
				After being stalked on the way home one night Ren was attacked by someone with the intention of sexual assault.  Before any actual criminal intent, Ren was able to pin the attacker to the wall and beat him to near death.  After arriving home quite upset, she learned her father was killed in a car crash earlier that day.  Fearing some stroke of bad luck or a curse had suddenly blanketed her life, Ren panicked in the moment and broke down. Eventually after the break down Ren reemerged someone different, someone tired of the world picking on her and tearing her apart. At that moment is when she truly became why the legends called her "The Anger".
				<br><br>
				In a newly unwavering rage Ren faked a murder-suicide by hanging her mother and misleading authorities, leaving a note that she was going to jump off a nearby bridge.  Using the diversion she bleached her hair and took her father's weaponry and took the first opportunity out of Japan that she found. What she found was an American funded man-made island project built as a relief for climate change's possible rising water levels and whoever was willing to pay to leave everything behind and move. Instead what she got was two months of peaceful living followed by 99% of the population having 1% of all wealth then having been evicted into slums of shipping containers.
				<br><br>
				In that man-made island, which Ren refuses to name, she was personally selected by the leader of the counter revolution. A revolt formed by those willing to put their lives on the line to fight off sickness and poverty, and its leader saw Ren as an outcast with great potential. He was right, seeing Ren's marksmanship prowess and great rage for injustices upon her and funneling it into the revolution. With Ren a notable figure of the revolution she then finally formed the alias she's even still known by to present day: The Anger.
				<br><br>
				The revolution was a success with Ren's great skill and with her help the outside world was able to contact the island and restore order and comfortable life for all, the wealthy being acquitted for crimes of embezzlement after a longer than hoped for legal suit. With Ren second-in-command in the rebels and full of unsatisfied rage, she ordered one last assault before the wealthy were let go. The result was the explosive destruction of the central tower in the center of the island, where all the wealthy lived and then there died.
				<br><br>
				Ren left the island for good after that explosive assault, now scared of her rage and again lost like before. She left for America and hid realizing now that The Anger was a wanted figure for those who need someone silenced and wanted by the law for terrorism. A lost soul searching for meaning an escape, Ren found herself involved in a St. Paul police district in Minnesota after saving the life of a detective in a street shootout. Ren in an unassuming civilian attire just wanted to do the right thing, but after a bit of time following the incident the detective found Ren out as The Anger.
				<br><br>
				Instead of taking Ren in as the terrorist she rashly became the detective kept Ren under her thumb as a gun for hire to let loose on the scum that roamed the city, all and only giving Ren the alias of 警察 (Keisatsu, Police) for her to be known by as Ren's Japanese origin would help them identify each other with. The two would become close, romantically so, but Ren felt too conflicted about her life path to let true feelings of love to get in the way. Only few people know of Ren's bisexual nature because of how troubled she is by her past. After not a lot of time with this life, Ren being given housing and basic necessities for her troubles, her apartment was raided by SWAT led by Keisatsu. Instead of being arrested like Ren thought, Keisatsu took out the SWAT team and held off reinforcements with Ren. After realizing the futility of the situation Keisatsu shot herself in front of Ren, leaving Ren no choice but to run with her weaponry and nothing else to some other sanctuary.
				<br><br>
				It would be a long time before the world heard of Ren Kimura, having gone dark back in Japan. Ren would dwell in slummy apartments and build upon her adept level of hacking she first learned back in that revolution. By luck or by skill she will never know but Ren secured herself a spot in a luxury apartment on the ocean coast of Yokohama, just east of Tokyo, and lives there to the present day. She took no hesitation to mask her signal and throw any level of authority or authentication away from her real identity and worked from the shadows in the highest story of that luxury apartment, types of housing complexes in Japan being called "mansions". There she honed her skills in traditional stealth arts and breaching cybersecurity discreetly.
				<br><br>
				Using her seemingly prodigy level of hacking skill she found her way inside the framework of a nearby military complex, finding many references to "A. Maximus" and "N. Hamilton". It was then that she reached out to Nate, who by that point had not been heard from for roughly 60 years. Unknown to his past or the complex's relations to the security forces on that island Ren agreed to meet up with Nate in Yokohama. At first she was clear towards what business she needed him for, but it was quick that the two fell for each other in some way. After a short fling and a successful stealth operation Ren had found herself in another emotional conflict. Realizing the situation was heading right to where it was with Keisatsu and that this Nate Hamilton was the same from half a century ago, the one involved in an operation that killed her grandfather (father's father), Ren executed Nate in the complex and escaped to her apartment.
				<br><br>
				By that point Ren had been finding a means to hold her anger and hatred away from society by venting it all out into an electric guitar, a Flying V. It came out that over time Ren became very skilled in rock and metal guitar play, and still enjoys it for venting and for fun to this day.
				<br><br>
				Over time Ren would learn a lot about the people Nate was connected to as friendships formed and memories were made, surprisingly while Nate was upset at the pain he never held it against her for what she did. From him would she meet the likes of Aki, Ashton, Alex, Kari, Aaron, and more over time. She would get to know all of them and their skills without the fear of betrayal or sudden upheaval. She would try love one more time before realizing that perhaps love will never find her, instead defaulting back to her belief in Zen Buddhism she formed over years of resenting being so hateful.
				<br><br>
				In recent times would she find herself close to Kari, like many others, and be thankful for one particular feat she did for Ren. This favor would inspire something more in Ren to do more than show compassion to others, and instead be loving to those who personally help her.
