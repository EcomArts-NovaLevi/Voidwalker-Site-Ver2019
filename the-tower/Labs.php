				Not much is known of the character rather than what they do, not even their motive is clear to anyone.  The only link made of Mr. Nobody is to Alex, Aaron, and Nate. All three of them recall knowing him in memory despite that Alex is much younger than the other two. All three of them almost want to say he was a childhood friend, but their childhoods were at much different times in history and not all together.
				<br>
				<br>
				Despite all inconsistencies and confusion he brings, everyone can agree on the fact that his real name is shortened down to them as "Labs". What they don't know is that Labs is short for Labsancthizar, a half-human half-demon exile from the layers of hell who takes his revenge by killing all demons that make it out and into World Zero. Ren made the acquaintance of Labs as a means of maybe finding rest for his wrath, but instead simply fueled it after realizing the futility. Labs would take his revenge the most off of Earth and as hell escaped throughout the Solar System like on the Moon and on Mars.
				<br>
				<br>
				The reason for the strange familiarity people have to Labs has been theorized that he used certain kids around time and space as a means to cope with his situation and realize the good in humanity. To see not what these youth do but instead what they feel from their heart. Others seem to think that this might just be a trick, and that Labs would rather be ripping out demon's hearts instead.
