			Here you've been directed towards the creative works from within my imaginative mind.  Here, you will find VOAU/Voidwalker.  VOAU is something I've worked on since I was a middle-schooler, however did not actually name this collection of characters and stories until my sophomore year in high school.  Then it wasn't until spring of 2019 that I really kicked things off to make a compelling and interesting world full of heroes, rivals, allies, and vile villains.  Proceed further if you wish to learn about just a handful of the many people that make up this (near) distant future.
